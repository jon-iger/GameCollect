# GameCollect
Game Collect is an independent iOS showcase project allowing users to manage their video game collections by scanning games.
- Display and organize favorite video games, search for new recommended games, and view screenshots, trailers, and game rating information.
- Utilized the RAWG and Barcode Lookup RESTful APIs and AVFoundation for UPC barcode scanning and integrated with Core Data and the Apple CloudKit framework using relational data management best practices to protect privacy.
- Developed with reusable SwiftUI view components and the MVVM object-oriented design architecture.
